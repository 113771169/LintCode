**0. [K Empty Slots.java](https://github.com/awangdev/LintCode/blob/master/Java/K%20Empty%20Slots.java)**      Level: Hard      Tags: [Array, BST, TreeSet]
      

题目解析后: find 2 number, that: 1. k slots between the 2 number, 2. no slots taken between the two number.

#### BST
- BST structure not given, use TreeSet to build BST with each node
- Every time find last/next inorder element 
- `treeSet.lower(x)`, `treeSet.higher(x)`
- 一旦位置相隔(k + 1), 就满足题目条件
- O(nlogn), good enough

#### Track slots of days
- Reverse the array, save days index into days[], where the new index is slot.
- days[i]: at slot i, which day a flower will be planted
- O(n)
