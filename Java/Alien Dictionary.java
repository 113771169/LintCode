/*

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. 
However, the order among letters are unknown to you. 
You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, 
where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. 
Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]
The correct order is: "wertf".

Example 2:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x"
]
The correct order is: "zx".

Example 3:
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
]
The order is invalid, so return "".

Note:
You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

	NOT DONE
	Thoughts:
	They have sink node. They form a valid tree, without sycle.
	A char can visit another node, does not mean they have order.
	A char appear in a lower row means they have different order.
	For 1st column, w appears before e, e appears before r.
	For 2nd column:r appears before t, t appears before f
	For 3rd col: t appears before f.
	For 4th col, nothing to compare.
	So make in[][]: [w,e] [e,r][r,t][t,f] based on the possible order.

	Then do topological sort on the sequence and mark the sequence like in course schedule II
